I never joined the bootcamp to be a developer. I joined because I wanted to think differently. I joined because I had an idea to create a platform to highlight hate crime. I joined because I was really curious. And even now, those reasons stand stronger. 

I remember attempting to do my first CLI project, and it was a hot mess because I didn't know where to start. But, line by line (write it out first if you have to), getting out of my own way (freedom over fear), and never stopping (allow for self-care) got me to the end. Am I the expert? No, but I can learn technologies faster and things click quicker.  Do I still have imposter syndrome? Of course, but I practice my code regularly and realize so do most people. Can I build things from start to finish (and solve a few hiccups in between)? Absolutely. 

However, the coding experience became less traumatic somewhere around Rails and then, it became almost huggable after doing JavaScript twice. But, it was not only about keeping at it--it was about what I chose to do with it. The passion comes when I go over the possibilities: how would I create a platform for underrepresented stories? What would a Q & A app look like? Can we solve the issues around intergenerational learning through AI aunties? 

Looking at my technical journey (and life), it has been sustained through questions, and I would advise my past and future self to keep playing, imagining and experimenting in all forms to get close to the roots of possible answers. And right now, as I am ready to graduate, I am still questioning: how can I make my portfolio more me? What if I made a 2D video game? Wouldn't it be cool to make a daily tarot reading site? 

Well, for me, these possibilities are now real.
